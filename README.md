# BMC
This repository is for users who would like to modify the partial BMC function of the following server product.  The README file will help you to accomplish the whole process.
First, you have to download the corresponding BMC images and update tool according to your server type here:

http://www.qct.io/Download/index/bmc

Next, By knowing your server type, you can find your BMC branch by looking up the mapping table below. 
Once you know what BMC branch you need, you can switch to that branch in this repository and download the source code you need.

After you've downloaded the source code, you can follow the instruction in the BMC_Module_Update_Instruction_v1.txt to finish the rest procedures. 

Here is the product name and branch mapping table.
